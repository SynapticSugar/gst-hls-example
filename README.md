# Gstreamer Live HLS
This example showcases a live HLS streaming setup using GStreamer, Node.js, and hls.js. GStreamer generates .ts segments and an m3u8 playlist, which Node/Express serves from the ./hls folder. In the browser, hls.js (or native Safari support) handles playback by continuously fetching new segments. The included configuration (liveSyncDurationCount, liveMaxLatencyDurationCount) helps keep the video stream near the live edge, providing a nearâ€“real-time experience.
It also supports multicast without requiring the pipeline to be re-instanced.
